# hello-world
first github project

Hi, I'm Tyler. I am a finance graduate from the University of Rhode Island (May 2017). I have worked a couple of different jobs/internships related to my major (insurance, banking, brokerage companies), but I never really found this jobs to be interesting or enjoyable. Currently (Jan 2019), I am a Technical Recruiter in Boston, MA and it really opened my eyes to Information Technology and Software Development.  

In high school I was part of an Interactive Digital Media program (graduated June in 2013). I was in this program for 3 years years (from soph-senior year) and I loved it. Not really because I learned anything, but mainly because my class was really close. Our teacher was the nicest (almost too nice), so we all just goofed off for 3 years basically. That wasn't my initial intent on joining the program. I remember walking through an active Digital Media class while I was touring the vocational school. Kids were using digital sketch pads to draw and using other programs to build games etc. It looked awesome, so that's what made me join. 

While in this class I came to like working in photoshop and made a couple of projects in Dreamweaver. Along the way I'm almost positive my teacher had to of exposed us to HTML and CSS for web design. Nonetheless, I didn't take my away (my own fault) but I always new I had an interest in technology, web design, graphic design, video-editing etc. But I never pursued it...

Fast foward to 2018. I'm a Series 7 and 66 Licensed Financial Representative at Merrill Edge (online brokerage owned by Bank of America) and I fucking hate it. At 23 years old I have no fucking clue what I want to do with my life, but I know I'd rather be broke and homeless than stay in this job. So after putting in hundreds of hours studying for the Series 7 and 66 and dealing with infintite bullshit from our clients over the phones totaling 10 months of sucking I quit and got a job as a recruiter in Boston. 

Long story short, my commute to Boston totalled around 3.5-4 hours a day. Most of which is spent on the commuter rail. I quickly learned that being a recruiter was not something I was passionate about (shocker.. still 10X better than Merrill Edge (fuck that place)), but being a tech recruiter exposed me to some of the things that I had interest in back in High School. So, after about a month of commuting my balls off twideling my thumbs on the train everyday I started to take action. I began bringing my $2000 MacBook with me that I had bought a year ago and only used onceand I started to fucking LEARN. 

I had a beginner book on python programming that was given to me my freshman year of college by some kid named Pedro in my dorm for a CSC110 class that by some miracle I passed (It wasn't a miracle, I paid the kid to do all of my homework assignments and final project). So I started ripping through this book and actually found this stuff interesting and I kept going. 

Fast forward.. (maybe one day I'll tell every detail thru a blog post on my own website)

What I've done to this point:
- made it through most that python book and another beginner python book
- completed about half of Team Treehouse Front-End Web Dev track, so I know HTML, CSS and JavaScript (some)
- now I've decided to run thru freecodecamp.com's program because it has structure and it's free

I'll keep you posted. 

Best,
Ty
